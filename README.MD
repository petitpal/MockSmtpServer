# MockSmtpServer

## Purpose
For now, this is just a hacked together server implementation so I don't need to send myself 20K emails for test purposes

## Future
Later on I'm intending to fill this out a bit more and impelment it in a half decent way - with some better message handling, ability to output to file, ability to request specific mail server failure types, etc
